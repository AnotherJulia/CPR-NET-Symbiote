# CPR-NET-Symbiote

CPR-NET-Symbiote is a TaleSpire Symbiote plugin that integrates a command-line hacking terminal into Cyberpunk Red campaigns. Players can interact with hackable props, doors, and systems by executing commands, initiating mini-games, and performing net-related tasks. The system differentiates between player roles, allowing dedicated netrunners to engage with unique mechanics, while GMs can oversee and approve interactions in real time.
