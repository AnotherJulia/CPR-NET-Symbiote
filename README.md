# CPR-NET-Symbiote

CPR-NET-Symbiote is a TaleSpire Symbiote plugin that integrates a command-line hacking terminal into Cyberpunk Red campaigns. Players can interact with hackable props, doors, and systems by executing commands, initiating mini-games, and performing net-related tasks. The system differentiates between player roles, allowing dedicated netrunners to engage with unique mechanics, while GMs can oversee and approve interactions in real time.

# Notes

For development, use `tsc --watch` to keep the dist/ js files up to date, then use live server or other app. for testing.
